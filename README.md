# arrow-gauntlet
A 3D printable phone-holding gauntlet, for the futurist in you.

## Intention
Phones are ubiquitous, and with the invention of USB-C and modern processors, fully functional IOT-controllers.
Why put it in your pocket, when you can wear it on your arm like a radical futurist!

This project will provide the parametric design needed to allow you to make a such a bizzare fashion statement.

## Stages
- [ ] Phone-insert
- [ ] Arm-brace
- [ ] Internal wiring-clips
- [ ] Battery-insert
- [ ] Exo-plating


## Building
This project is designed to be executed using a Nix-Flake.

Failing that, the python files should work with cadquery 2.1
